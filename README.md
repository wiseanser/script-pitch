Anser - the GTD-app that give your Tasks a Meaning
--------------------------------------------------

In a time of multitasking we still believe in the words of David Allen and **imagine a world where gtd is really working on your Apple environment.**

That is why we are a team of gtd-enthusiasts that develop an simple app which is organizing all tasks, mails and files for apple-user who want to escape their digital mess and search for an app that really helps to **focus on the creative work that they love.**

Other than gtd-apps like OmniFocus we are able to build a stable and trusting structure based on your file system up to 50.000 feet  that you really can forget on the runway and **we will not stop until every digital native gtd-fan knows there is a working way to get your things done with your Mac and iPhone.**

The Objectives of the video
---------------------------

- We want to share our idea of a working gtd system on your Mac and iPhone.
- We want to show our team.

- We want to motivate people to donate for our kickstarter projeckt.
- We want to motivate people to share their problems with digital gtd.
