Anser - the GTD app that gives your Tasks a Meaning
---------------------------------------------------

In a time of increased multitasking, we believe in the words of David Allen and imagine a world where GTD really works within your Apple environment.

As a team of GTD enthusiasts, we have developed a simple app which organizes all tasks, emails and files for the Apple user that wants to escape their digital clutter and use a single interface to provide a focus on the creative work that they love.

Unlike other GTD apps such as OmniFocus, we are able to build a stable and reliable structure based on your file system [up to 50,000 feet] that you really can forget about on the runway. We will not stop until every digital native GTD fan knows there is an effective way to get your things done with your Mac and iPhone.

The Objectives of the video
---------------------------

- We want to share our idea of a working GTD system on your Mac and iPhone. 
- We want to showcase our team. 
- We want to tell a story. 
- We want to motivate people to donate to our Kickstarter project. 
- We want to motivate people to share their problems with digital GTD.
